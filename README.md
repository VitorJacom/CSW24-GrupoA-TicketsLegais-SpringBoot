This is the README document, here will be showed some informations about the project.

### Introduction
This is an assignment made for our *Software Construction* class.
The goal of this project is to build a simple Backend API to further our understanding of software projects.

#### Specifications
This project should implement all functional requirements of an online platform for selling tickets for events such as parties, concerts and plays. The platform must support users re-selling tickets, secure monetary transfers, ticket authentication, and integration with official systems for ticket validation.

An in-depth explanation of the assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/tecmx/csw242-system-docs?tab=readme-ov-file#documenta%C3%A7%C3%A3o-da-plataforma-de-compra-e-venda-de-ingressos).

### This system aims to
- [ ] Export the API documentation through [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).
- [ ] Work as a backend API and be availiable for both local and remote access. (Due to monetary constraints, this may not be always availiable)
- [ ] Have a detailed description of the project's infrastructure

### Technical information
We have decided to use the [Java](https://www.java.com) programing language and use [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
